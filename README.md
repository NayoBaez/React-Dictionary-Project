# DICTIONARY DASHBOARD

I built this dictionary React App with a Search Engine feature. As you might have noticed by now I am crazy about photography, so adding the image feature here was a must. The app utilizes React, JSX, CSS, Bootstrap, Axios and the Dictionaryapi.dev & Pexels API integrations. This project allowed me to become really familiar with incorporating JSX conditional rendering, looping though arrays and organising files into components for simplicity.
